# Datavidia-7.0-Competition
On February 2021, my friends (https://www.linkedin.com/in/msammyivank/ and https://www.linkedin.com/in/imavv/) and I joined data competition that is Arkavidia 7.0 Datavidia Competition held by HMIF ITB. For this preliminary round, we were given Natural Language Processing task with binary classification. The task was about classifying Indonesia hotel reviews whether positive or negative. 

To predict this binary classification NLP task, we utilized state-of-the-art deep learning model that is BERT. But we used the Indonesian one, pre-trained IndoBERT model that was developed recently (2020) by Indonesian researchers (https://www.indobenchmark.com/). By utilizing this model we achieved F1 macro score around 0.92. The competition Kaggle link is stated below.
